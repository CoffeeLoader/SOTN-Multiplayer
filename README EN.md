## Beginning of Page
In this repository I will be making available a unique Gameshark code that allows you to have a very simple Multiplayer Mode playing with Familiar. All the codes here are completely free and were made from scratch with the help of tools like the Cheat Engine, any similarity with the addresses of other users is pure coincidence.

### PS1 emulator that I recommend:
* https://github.com/stenzek/duckstation - Duckstation

# Requirements
* Any System that runs PS1 and that supports Gameshark.
* A Control connected to Port 2, in the case of an emulator, a control configured to Port 2.
* A Backup of your Game. (SLUS-00067)

# Multiplayer Features (v1.2)

* All Familiars already Unlocked at Castle Entrance.
* Change Familiar Position using DPAD.
* Take control of the Familiars.
* Improvements related to the positioning of the Familiar on the Screen.
* Change Familiar in Inventory.
* Skills for Bat.
* Skills for Ghost.
* Skills for Faerie.
* Skills for Demon.
* Skills for Sword.
* Skills for Pixie.
* Skills for Nose Devil.
* 5 Easter Eggs/Secrets.

# Useful Fixes (Optional)

* Removes Black Borders, but may leave some astefacts visible.
* Make corrections in Alucard's Inventory, in Duckstation's video options put (Aspect Ratio: 4:3 and Crop: All Edges).
* Opens the trapdoor at the entrance of the Normal and Inverted Castle, playing with Alucard it is necessary to have the Leap Stone relic for the trapdoor to open.
* Makes Wing Smash Infinite.
* Force Stereo Audio Mode.
* Corrects the Japanese names of the Pixie and NDevil Familiars, this code has conditions to avoid problems in translated versions of the game.
* Allows P1 to enable Pixie and Nose Devil, activate Faerie or Demon relic and press Select

# Hard Mode + Familiar Cloak (Optional)
## Hard Mode
(Start a New Game and type HARDMODE)
* Limit 200 HP, 50 MP and 50 Hearts.
* Extremely Low Status. (STR:1 CON:1 INT:1 LCK:1)
* Infinite Poison, reduces damage and defense in addition to not allowing MP regeneration.
* Glitch changes valid only for Hard Mode.
* Ban on Soul Steal and Shield Rod + Alucard Shield skills.
* Extended Dodge.
* Minor changes in Music.
* Start with the Familiar Cloak in the Inventory.

## Familiar Cloak
(Buy from Librarian or start New Game using FAMILIAR name, replace Reverse Cloak)
* Brings special abilities depending on the Familiar playing.
* The inside of the cape changes color depending on which Familiar is playing.
* When the Familiar reaches LV 99, you gain this ability permanently, as long as you are wearing the Cloak.
* Although it was designed for Hard Mode, it also works in normal game.

# Known Issues
* There is a bug in the game that causes the Bridge at the Entrance of the Abandoned Mine to break when pressing Triangle on the Second Controller, something similar can also happen in other areas of the game.
* It is not possible to open the gates of the Abandoned Mine, so they will always be open.
* I couldn't give good support to Bat and Ghost, so they are not the most recommended to play.
